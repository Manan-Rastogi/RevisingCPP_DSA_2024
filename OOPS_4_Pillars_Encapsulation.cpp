	Encapsulation:
		-	Wrapping Up data members and functions to a single entity
		-	Information Hiding/ Data Hiding
		-	Data Members -> Properties/State
		-	Functions -> Methods/Behaviour
		-	Achieved using class
		-	Fully Encapsulated class - where all data members are private.
		
	Adv:
		-	we can hide data ==> increase security
		-	If we want we can make class Read Only.
		-	Code Reuseability
		-	unit Testing becomes easy.

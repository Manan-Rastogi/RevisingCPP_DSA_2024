	1. 								Null Pointer
	A NULL pointer is a pointer that is pointing to nothing. If we donâ€™t have the address to be assigned to a pointer, we can use NULL.

	Advantages of Null pointer:
	-> We can initialize a pointer variable when that pointer variable is not assigned any actual memory address.
	-> We can pass a null pointer to a function argument when we are unwilling to pass any actual memory address.

	/*
	3.								Void Pointer

	A void pointer is a generic pointer; it has no associated type with it. A void pointer can hold an address of any type and can be typecasted to any type


	REMEMBER:
	->	void pointers cannot be dereferenced. It can, however, be done using typecasting the void pointer.
	->	Pointer arithmetic is not possible on pointers of void due to lack of concrete value and size.

	/*
	4.								Wild Pointer

	A pointer behaves like a wild pointer when declared but not initialized. So, they point to any random memory location.

	/*
	5.							 	Dangling Pointer

	A dangling pointer is a pointer pointing to a memory location that has been freed (or deleted).

	A Pointer becomes a dangling pointer when:
	i> Function Call: return address of a static variable of func.
		int * fun() {
   				 int x = 10;
    			 return &x;
			}

	ii> Deallocation of memory: 
		 /		/dynamic memory allocation.
			    int * p = (int * ) malloc(sizeof(int));
			    
			    //after calling free() p becomes a dangling pointer
			    free(p);
			    
			    //now p no more a dangling pointer.
			    p = NULL;

	iii> Variable goes out of scope:
		  	int * ptr;
		    ..... //any code statements
		    {   int ch;
		        ptr = & ch;
		    }
		    ....
		    // Here ptr is dangling pointer
